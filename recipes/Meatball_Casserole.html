    <h1>Meatball Casserole</h1>
    <img src="../images/meatball_caserole.jpg" alt="Meatball Casserole">
    <p>When you have meatballs in the freezer to use up, this is a great go-to meal. I created it to feed two comfortably, and it can easily be doubled to feed a crowd.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces rotini pasta</li>
        <li>1 (24 ounce) jar prepared marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup prepared pizza sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>10 frozen cooked meatballs, thawed</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir rotini, marinara sauce, water, pizza sauce, and milk together in a bowl. Pour into a deep baking dish; pasta should be completely submerged in sauce. Cover dish tightly with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes; uncover and arrange meatballs on top, pushing them partially into pasta and sauce; cover tightly with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 20 to 30 minutes more.</li>
        <lI>Uncover; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese; return to oven for 5 minutes. Remove and let cool 5 minutes before serving.</lI>
